		<h3>Overwatch</h3>
		<p>Overwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of several pre-defined hero characters with unique movement, attributes, and skills; these heroes are divided into four classes: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map and/or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time.</p>

		<h3>Rocket League</h3>
		<p>Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to one of two teams, using rocket-engine equipped vehicles to push a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a timed match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions, as well as cross-play between Xbox One and Windows versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and adding new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.</p>

		<h3>Destiny</h3>
		<p>Destiny is a first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it is the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes. Now Destinys story was really bad and it still is. The reason why i like this game is because of the same reason i love pokemon its because the overall goal to catch them all. In destiny there are certain pieces of weapons and armor that are so powerful that you can only have one on at a time and i want to collect them all. Destiny in my opinon is a really bad habbit becuase you can get really hooked in the game and once you do you are going to want more off it sadly the dlc for this game ranges from 20-40 dollers which is really expensive for a dlc.</p>
